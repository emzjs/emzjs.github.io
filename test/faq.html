    <h1>FAQ for THE LEGENDZ Community</h1>

    <section id="join"><div>
      <h2 style="--c:#95a5a6;">How Do I Get Into <span><span></span><span>#general</span></span></h2>
      <p>We do not have an instant invite for the server. Instead, use this link: <a href="https://replit.com/discord">https://replit.com/discord</a></p>
    </div></section>

    <section id="disconnected"><div>
      <h2>My repl won't start</h2>
      <p>If your repl is consistently failing to connect, open the <code>Shell</code> tab and type <code>kill 1</code>. Refresh your page and keep trying - it will probably work eventually. If you're getting a message like <code>package operation failed</code> but you know your packages are correct, try removing all your packages then typing <code>kill 1</code> in shell and refreshing your page.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section id="restarting"><div>
      <h2>My repl keeps restarting</h2>
      <p>Even if you are using Always On or a webserver, your repl will restart every few hours. There is nothing you can do about this.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section id="env"><div>
      <h2>Hiding passwords, tokens and other secrets</h2>
      <p>You can hide your passwords, tokens, and other things you don't want people to see, using environment variables. Read <a href="https://docs.replit.com/repls/secrets-environment-variables">this page</a> to learn how to do this.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section id="node14"><div>
      <h2>Changing NodeJS version</h2>
      <p>The Replit team are working on changing the NodeJS repl to use version 14. For now, you can use a Bash repl, as these have version 14 preinstalled. In a Bash repl, make a JavaScript file, for example <code>index.js</code>. In the file <code>main.sh</code>, type <code>node index.js</code>, replacing <code>index.js</code> with the name of the file you created.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section id="keepalive"><div>
      <h2>Keeping repls online</h2>
      <p>There are two options for this. Either buy Hacker plan and use <a href="https://docs.replit.com/repls/always-on">Always On</a>, or create a webserver and use an HTTP uptime service. Here are tutorials for doing this for a Discord bot, in <a href="https://replit.com/talk/learn/Hosting-discordpy-bots-with-replit/11008">Python</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/talk/learn/Hosting-discordjs-bots-on-replit-Works-for-both-discordjs-and-Eris/11027">JavaScript</a>, but the concept works for anything in any language.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section id="hacker"><div>
      <h2>Where can I get a code for Hacker plan?</h2>
      <p>You cannot. Pay for it like everybody else.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section id="roles"><div>
      <h2>Server roles</h2>
      <p>
        Here are the main server roles, and what they represent:

          <li style="--c:#95a5a6;"><span><span></span><span>@Replit Team</span></span>: Reserved role. Held by Replit employees and interns.</li>
          <li style="--c:#8144f8;"><span><span></span><span>@Head Mod</span></span>: Reserved role. Held by the overseer of moderators. Acts as head of all server moderators (chat and event), manages server-wide rules, and resolves conflicts between mods. Has executive power over all server decisions and holds moderators accountable.</li>
          <li style="--c:#3498db;"><span><span></span><span>@Chat Mod</span></span>: Appointed role. Group of moderators who supervise the behavior of server members in both text chat and voice channels, and enforces the server rules accordingly.

          <li style="--c:#fa8072;"><span><span></span><span>@Replit Site Moderator</span></span>: People who moderate the Replit website. Do not ping them for issues in this Discord server, and if you've found a bad post on Repl Talk, use the built-in report feature.</li>
          <li style="--c:#e74c3c;"><span><span></span><span>@Replit Hero</span></span>: People who have made direct contributions to Replit. Do not ask for this role or do things specifically to try and get it.</li>
