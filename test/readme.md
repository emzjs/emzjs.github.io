### About
Sick of short urls redirecting you to websites that you don't want to go ? Not sure what kind of websites you're going to visit ? You've came to the right place ! 
  
#### How It Works
After you enter a url, our server will crawl the website and search for meta tags, for example : description, title, keywords, author and more. After that we'll try to take a screenshot of the page. Then we'll send all the information we've got to you.
